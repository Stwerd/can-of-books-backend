# Project Name

**Author**: Jackson Gurney, David Suy
**Version**: 1.0.0

## Overview
READ book data by connecting your front-end React app to a back-end Express server. Your Express server will connect to a Mongo database. You will need to make a “schema” in your back-end code to model how you want your data to look. You will then populate your database with “seed” data—some of your favorite books. When the front end makes a request to your server, your server will query the database and respond with all of the results from the database. Your front end will display these results.

## Getting Started
Sign up for mongo Atlas, connect the query from front end to back end, and import data from the mongo database.

## Architecture
mongo,
servers,
react,
js
